<h1>ezChat</h1>
ezChat is a simple web based topic chatting application implemented using webpack bundler and google's firebase.

ezChat was written in javascript and you might need to run some npm commands to run it in your local. Once you have the project opened in your local, you'll need to follow these steps:
<ul>
  <li>Open terminal</li>
  <li>Run "npm i" to install all dependencies</li>
  <li>Run "npm run build" to run the webpack script</li>
  <li>Voila! All you need to do now is open with a live server or through any method you deem suitable</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extending ezChat </h3>
To enhance ezChat's appeal and functionality, presented below is a rundown of features I aim to incorporate:
<ul>
  <li>Implement a login and signup page</li>
  <li>Allow users edit and delete messages</li>
  <li>Increase the numbers of topics available and allow users pick topics they would want to follow/discuss in</li>
</ul>
